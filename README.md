# Federated-Learning-Simulation
Program that tests MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, on various neural nets, such as a simple CNN, vgg, and Resnet.
Currently compatibly with simple CNN and VGG neural net. Resnet not yet available.
Program will automatically download datasets. 
Follow the prompts and the program will return a plot of the accuracy vs epochs 
Multiprocessesing and sequential are both available
